# APOE-CR Project

This repository contains analysis code for the APOE-CR project, examining how human APOE genotypes modulate caloric restriction effects against aging in the brain and periphery.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **Brain bulk RNAseq**: Contains brain bulk RNA sequencing data analysis and visualization
2. **Brain lipidome**: Contains brain lipidome analysis and visualization
3. **Serum lipidome**: Contains serum lipidome analysis and visualization
4. **Gut microbiome**: Contains gut microbiome data analysis and visualization

## Overview

This project investigates the human APOE genotype-dependent effects of caloric restriction on the brain transcriptomics, brain lipidome, serum lipidome, and gut microbiome composition in the aged mice.
