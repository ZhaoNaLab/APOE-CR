# APOE-CR Project

This repository contains analysis code for the APOE-CR project, examining the effects of APOE genotype and caloric restriction on multiple biological systems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **1-Brain bulk RNAseq**: Contains brain bulk RNA sequencing data and analysis
2. **2-Brain lipidome**: Contains brain lipidome analysis
3. **3-Serum lipidome**: Contains serum lipidome analysis
4. **4-Gut microbiome**: Contains gut microbiome data and analysis

## Overview

This project investigates the interactions between APOE genotype and caloric restriction, focusing on their combined effects on brain transcriptomics, brain lipidome, serum lipidome, and gut microbiome composition.
