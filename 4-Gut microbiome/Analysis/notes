•	 profile_sample.sh: script for processing the samples as array jobs on SGE
•	merge_output.R: script for merging the output files from profile_sample.sh
•	run_zicoseq_and_pcoa.R: script that runs zicoseq (including creating the excel file) + creates the pcoa plots. I double-checked and tested to make sure it reproduces the figures and data in your previous attachment.
